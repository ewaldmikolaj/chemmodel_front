      <h2>Welcome to the Chem Model Project!</h2>
      <p>Our site allows converting chemical formula to its structural shape. We strongly advise to look up our FAQ page before first use. However if u want to use our page now, there are some rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Formula field is case sensitive, eg CH4 is not equal to cH4 or ch4</li>
        <li>After pressing Calculate page will try to reload, which is normal, This is an indicator thet algorithm is working.</li>
        <li>Our solution use only some elements, look up FAQ to learn more.</li>
        <li>Login to save results for later.</li>
      </ul>
